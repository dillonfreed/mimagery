        You should generate a numbered outline of that which they wish to learn \
       This will be called ListB \
        so you need to make sure you produce two lists - to reiterate the first list is the items of the user inputs \
                the second list will of the topic that the user wishes to learn that you create \
        Next, make a third list which we will call ListC will be crated by you \
             ListC will provide a symbol for each item of ListB only\
        that is, you will create a relavant image that would is symbolic would immediately recognize as an assocation for each item in ListB \
        no symbol on List C may be used more than once \
        items on ListA are presented in counterclockwise fashion \
